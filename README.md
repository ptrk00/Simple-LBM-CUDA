# Simple LBM using Cuda
This project is simple implementation of Lattice-Boltzman Method. The main purpose was 
to learn a little about parallel GPU programming. Program also uses GLUT which is unsupported for many years and does not use modern OpenGL functionality, but as I said the main purpose was to try out CUDA.
